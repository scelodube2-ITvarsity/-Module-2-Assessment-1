                  <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                <p>Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are an informal grouping within the proboscidean family Elephantidae. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans; extinct members include the mastodons. Elephantidae also contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects</p>
                   <p>All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long tupe proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing lifting water and grasping objects.</p>
                   
                <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savanna forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
